    The gain is computed from three components:
    
        entry gain: That is the gain which results from have the state
                    entries implemented in a single state. This gain 
                    results from command lists appearring in both states.
                    Instead of being implemented twice, they are 
                    implemented once.

        drop-out gain: Like 'entry gain' respectively for drop outs.

        transition map gain: The gain from combining the state's tran-
                             sition map.
