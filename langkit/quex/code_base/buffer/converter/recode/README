This is the converter interface for using Francois Pinard's librecode for
character conversions.  The library is available at:

      ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/recode/recode-3.6.tar.gz

Alternatively, if you are using Linux, most major distributions come
with a package that is somehow called like 'recode' or 'recode-devel'.
Search for it with your favorite installer, and you might save the
effort of compiling and installing it by hand.
