This example is provided to help programmers to replace in a program
GNATCOLL.Projects package references by GPR2 packages use.

The program loads a project using optional parameters for target, runtime,
scenario variables, etc...

A GPR2_GNATCOLL_Projects package is provided to simplify conversion providing
an API close to GNATCOLL.Projects API. This package can be copied and extended
inside the source files of the project you plan to modify.
